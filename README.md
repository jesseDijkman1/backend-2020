## Intro
This project was created for the course: Backend and Project Tech. The idea was to create a single feature from a dating app. The feature I picked is a chat feature with the abillity to send gifs.

## Installation Guide
`git clone https://github.com/jesseDijkman1/dating-app-feature.git`
`cd dating-app-feature`
`npm install`

You'll need to setup a `.env` file with these values:
```env
DB_CONNECT=[MONGO DATABASE URL]
GIPHY_API_KEY=[API KEY FROM GIPHY.COM]
```

## Goals
Before I started I knew I wanted to make it accessible. This means the feature can be used without JavaScript. The plan was to progressively enhance the code, so it would later on support `IO` (input/output).
